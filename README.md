# Special Notes

To Avoid soft locking in current build:

1. Do not take more than 20 photos before completing the demo or the phone will be full and you'll softlock your progress.

2. Photos are saved to AppData/LocalLow/KIMMIE/Resource/Snapshots and must be deleted manually after playing the demo.

3. Upon Kimmie prompting to travel to the Studio, press T on the keyboard to travel there as the phone's Map menu currently does not function as intended

4. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tc44LYNsQmKdRe6eS-epI53JdTw3nHIm/view?usp=sharing (Build Link due to big Rss file blocking Git upload)
