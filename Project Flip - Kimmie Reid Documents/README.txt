Git Repo: https://github.com/RemiJu/Project-Flip-Kimmie-Reid/tree/main

Notes:

1. Do not take more than 20 photos before completing the demo or the phone will be full and you'll softlock your progress.

2. Photos are saved to AppData/LocalLow/KIMMIE/Resource/Snapshots and must be deleted manually after playing the demo.

3. Upon Kimmie prompting to travel to the Studio, press T on the keyboard to travel there as the phone's Map menu currently does not function as intended

Build Location: Due to Git having limits on uploads atm and a pesky RSS file.
